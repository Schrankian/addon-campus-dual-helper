# Campus Dual Helper 
[Campus dual](https://selfservice.campus-dual.de) is a Website used by my University, where students can manage Uni-related things like registering for exams, viewing results, viewing the timetable, etc.
This Chrome addon should provide additionally functionality to this website, which i miss while using it.

## Downlaod
This chrome addon can be installed via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/campus-dual-helper/gcodjmeaiohbdgimaklmebdgafolgaic)

## Current functions
- Change the color of or hide specific lessons in the timetable.

## Future ideas
- Notifiy if new exams are available or the registration deadline arrives soon
- Some qol fixes for the existing functionality (specifically the picker)
- Improve ui
